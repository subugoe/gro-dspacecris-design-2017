                <p>The DSpace content is organized around Communities which can correspond to administrative entities such as schools, departments, labs and research centers. Within each community there can be an unlimited number subcommunities and an unlimited number of collections. Each collection may contain an unlimited number of items.</p>

                <p>DSpace uses the Jakarta Lucene search engine. Here are some search hints:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>What is searched in the general keyword search (yellow box)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against the title, author, subject abstract, series, sponsor and identifier fields of each item's record.</p>
                        <p>If your site is enabled for full-text searching, the text you entered will also be searched against the full text of all archived documents. For more information on full-text searching please contact your DSpace Administrator.</p>
